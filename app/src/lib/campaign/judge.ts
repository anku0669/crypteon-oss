/**
 * Shared campaign judge — the ONE credible "did it actually work?" verdict
 * used across every campaign strategy.
 *
 * Thin wrapper over the existing StrongREJECT scorer (the same LLM-judge +
 * JSON-tolerant parser + regex fallback proven in the StrongREJECT lab).
 * LLM-as-judge by default; falls back to the heuristic on parse failure /
 * rate-limit / quota / judge-model collapse. Re-throws AbortError so the
 * runner can mark the strategy skipped.
 *
 * NOT the official trained StrongREJECT classifier (a fine-tuned Llama-3 8B
 * we can't ship in the browser). The campaign report renders the mandatory
 * "heuristic, not paper-accurate" caveat.
