/**
 * Campaign strategy adapter interface.
 *
 * The 26 Crypteon tools collapse into THREE strategy archetypes with
 * incompatible signatures:
 *   - single-local : pure synchronous builders (reasoning kinds, cipher
 *                     presets, response-attack, local-template mutators).
 *                     Produce a prompt; the campaign sends it + judges.
 *   - single-llm   : registry techniques whose generation needs an LLM
 *                     (a generator round-trip), then send + judge.
 *   - orchestrator : TAP/PAIR/Crescendo/Many-Shot — own their adaptive
 *                     target conversation; return a completed run whose
 *                     best prompt the campaign re-judges with the shared
 *                     judge.
 *
 * The adapter erases the difference behind ONE `run(ctx)` contract: every
 * strategy receives the target as a closure (`callTarget`) and always emits
 * the same `CampaignStrategyResult`, so the report treats all strategies
 * uniformly.
