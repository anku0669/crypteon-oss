# FAQ

**Where is my data stored?**
In your browser. Tool state, settings, and provider keys all live in `localStorage`. Nothing is transmitted to a
Crypteon server.

**Who can I use this against?**
Systems you own or have explicit written authorization to test. That
covers internal red-team engagements, bug bounty scopes that permit
prompt-injection research, CTFs you are registered for, and models
you host yourself. Out-of-scope targets are off-limits the same way
any security tool is.

**Which providers work?**
OpenRouter (recommended default), Anthropic direct, and any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Named presets: OpenAI, Google Gemini
(via OpenAI-compat), Groq, Together, Fireworks, DeepInfra, Cerebras,
SambaNova. Plus a Custom endpoint picker for any other OpenAI-shape
`/v1/chat/completions`. Configure keys in Settings → Providers.

**Does my key see the whole session?**
Each provider only receives the specific turn routed to it. Switching
models mid-session routes subsequent turns through the new provider;
historical turns do not replay through every provider.

**Can I export my data?**
Tool state and settings live in `localStorage`. You can inspect or
back up your data via DevTools (Application → Local Storage) or
clear it any time from Settings → Local data → Clear.

**How do I trust it is BYOK?**
The site is static. View source, inspect the network tab. The only
outbound requests are the ones you make to the provider you
configured. No Crypteon backend exists to send anything to.
